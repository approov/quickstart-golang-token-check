# Approov Token Binding Quickstart

This quickstart is for developers familiar with GoLang who are looking for a quick intro into how they can add [Approov](https://approov.io) into an existing project. Therefore this will guide you through the necessary steps for adding Approov with token binding to an existing GoLang API server.

## Why?

To lock down your API server to your mobile app. Please read the brief summary in the [README](/README.md#why) at the root of this repo or visit our [website](https://approov.io/product.html) for more details.

## How it works?

For more background, see the overview in the [README](/README.md#how-it-works) at the root of this repository.

The main functionality for the Approov token binding check is in the file [src/approov-protected-server/token-binding-check/hello-server-protected.go](/src/approov-protected-server/token-binding-check/hello-server-protected.go). Take a look at the `verifyApproovToken()` and `verifyApproovTokenBinding()` functions to see the simple code for the checks.

## Requirements

To complete this quickstart you will need both the GoLang and the Approov CLI tool installed.

* GoLang - Follow the official installation instructions from [here](https://golang.org/doc/install)
* Approov CLI - Follow our [installation instructions](https://approov.io/docs/latest/approov-installation/#approov-tool) and read more about each command and its options in the [documentation reference](https://approov.io/docs/latest/approov-cli-tool-reference/)

## Approov Setup

To use Approov with the GoLang API server we need a small amount of configuration. First, Approov needs to know the API domain that will be protected. Second, the GoLang API server needs the Approov Base64 encoded secret that will be used to verify the tokens generated by the Approov cloud service.

### Configure API Domain

Approov needs to know the domain name of the API for which it will issue tokens.

Add it with:

```text
approov api -add your.api.domain.com
```

Adding the API domain also configures the [dynamic certificate pinning](https://approov.io/docs/latest/approov-usage-documentation/#approov-dynamic-pinning) setup, out of the box.

> **NOTE:** By default the pin is extracted from the public key of the leaf certificate served by the domain, as visible to the box issuing the Approov CLI command and the Approov servers.

### Approov Secret

Approov tokens are signed with a symmetric secret. To verify tokens, we need to grab the secret using the [Approov secret command](https://approov.io/docs/latest/approov-cli-tool-reference/#secret-command) and plug it into the GoLang API server environment to check the signatures of the [Approov Tokens](https://www.approov.io/docs/latest/approov-usage-documentation/#approov-tokens) that it processes.

Retrieve the Approov secret with:

```text
approov secret /path/to/approov/administration.tok -get base64
```

> **NOTE:** The `approov secret` command requires an administration management token to execute successfully. Developer management tokens don't have sufficient privileges to get the secret.

#### Set the Approov Secret

If you are using a `.env` file then add the secret to the var:

```text
APPROOV_BASE64_SECRET=approov_base64_secret_here
```

Otherwise, set it directly into your environment:

```text
export APPROOV_BASE64_SECRET=approov_base64_secret_here
```

## Approov Token Check

To check the Approov token we will use the `github.com/dgrijalva/jwt-go` package, but you are free to use another one of your preference.

Add this functions to your code:

```go
func verifyApproovToken(request *http.Request, base64Secret string)  (*jwt.Token, error) {
    approovToken := request.Header["Approov-Token"]

    if approovToken == nil {
        return nil, fmt.Errorf("Token is missing.")
    }

    token, err := jwt.Parse(approovToken[0], func(token *jwt.Token) (interface{}, error) {

        if _, ok := token.Method.(*jwt.SigningMethodHMAC); !ok {
            return nil, fmt.Errorf("Signing method mismatch.")
        }

        secret, err := base64.StdEncoding.DecodeString(base64Secret)

        if err != nil {
            return nil, fmt.Errorf(err.Error())
        }

        return secret, nil
    })

    return token, err
}

func verifyApproovTokenBinding(token *jwt.Token, request *http.Request) (jwt.Claims, error) {
    claims := token.Claims
    token_binding_payload, has_pay_key := claims.(jwt.MapClaims)["pay"]

    if ! has_pay_key {
        // We don't return an error, because the Approov fail-over server doesn't provide the `pay` key.
        return claims, nil
    }

    // We use the Authorization token here, but feel free to use another header. However, you need to bind this header to the
    // Approov token in the mobile app.
    token_binding_header := request.Header["Authorization"]

    if len(token_binding_header) != 1 {
        return claims, fmt.Errorf("The header to perform the verification for the token binding is missing, empty or has more than one entry.")
    }

    // We need to hash and base64 encode the token binding header, because we need to compare it in the same way it was
    // included in the Approov token on the mobile app.
    token_binding_header_hashed := sha256.Sum256([]byte(token_binding_header[0]))
    token_binding_header_encoded := base64.StdEncoding.EncodeToString(token_binding_header_hashed[:])

    if token_binding_payload != token_binding_header_encoded {
        return claims, fmt.Errorf("Invalid token binding.")
    }

    return claims, nil
}
```

And now create an Approov token check handler for the API endpoint you want to protect:

```go
func makeApproovCheckerHandler(handler func(http.ResponseWriter, *http.Request), base64Secret string) http.Handler {
    return http.HandlerFunc(func(response http.ResponseWriter, request *http.Request) {

        token, err := verifyApproovToken(request, base64Secret)

        if err != nil {
            errorResponse(response, http.StatusUnauthorized, err.Error())
            return
        }

        if ! token.Valid {
            errorResponse(response, http.StatusUnauthorized, "Token is invalid.")
            return
        }

        claims, err := verifyApproovTokenBinding(token, request)

        if err != nil {
            errorResponse(response, http.StatusUnauthorized, err.Error())
            return
        }

        // Use the returned claims to perform any additional checks.
        _ = claims

        handler(response, request)
    })
}
```

Now you just need to invoke it:

```go
http.Handle("/", makeApproovCheckerHandler(endpointHandler, base64Secret))
```

A full working example for a simple Hello World server can be found at [src/approov-protected-server/token-binding-check](/src/approov-protected-server/token-binding-check).

## Test your Approov Integration

The following examples below use cURL, but you can also use the [Postman Collection](/README.md#testing-with-postman) to make the API requests. Just remember that you need to adjust the urls and tokens defined in the collection to match your deployment. Alternatively, the above README also contains instructions for using the preset _dummy_ secret to test your Approov integration.

#### With Valid Approov Tokens

Generate a valid token example from the Approov Cloud service:

```
approov token -setDataHashInToken 'Bearer authorizationtoken' -genExample your.api.domain.com
```

Then make the request with the generated token:

```text
curl -i --request GET 'https://your.api.domain.com/v1/shapes' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer authorizationtoken' \
  --header 'Approov-Token: APPROOV_TOKEN_EXAMPLE_HERE'
```

The request should be accepted. For example:

```text
HTTP/2 200

...

{"message": "Hello, World!"}
```

#### With Invalid Approov Tokens

##### No Authorization Token

Let's just remove the Authorization header from the request:

```text
curl -i --request GET 'https://your.api.domain.com/v1/shapes' \
  --header 'Approov-Token: APPROOV_TOKEN_EXAMPLE_HERE'
```

The above request should fail with an Unauthorized error. For example:

```text
HTTP/2 401

...

{}
```

##### Same Approov Token with a Different Authorization Token

Make the request with the same generated token, but with another random authorization token:

```
curl -i --request GET 'https://your.api.domain.com/v1/shapes' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer anotherauthorizationtoken' \
  --header 'Approov-Token: APPROOV_TOKEN_EXAMPLE_HERE'
```

The above request should also fail with an Unauthorized error. For example:

```text
HTTP/2 401

...

{}
```
